<h3>Why is Learning About AI Important for Kids?</h3>
AI is all around us, and whether or not you realize it, people use artificial intelligence every single day. Even though
AI is used today,
computer scientists predict artificial intelligence will be even more prominent in the future. Because of this, many
jobs will also need us to
understand how AI works so we can solve big problems. This is already true of many professions today. Doctors use AI to
diagnose patients based on
medical scans, like X-rays. Astronauts can use AI models to detect exoplanets, or planets outside our Solar System.
